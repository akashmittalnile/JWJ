						<h1>Why Journey with Journals? </h1>
						<p>Journey with Journals gives you a simple and easy to use platform for you to document your journey through Life! Each day comes to us one at a time. It is up to you to record and cherish moments that happen along your journey. It may not seem important now, but down the road of life you will appreciate the ability to go back and experience those special moments you had with family and friends.</p>
						<p>Journey with Journals gives you the means to overcome all the obstacles that have kept you from recording your memories. The days of finding a pen and your journal book are in the past. Finding time to preserve your memories is no longer an issue. Losing your journal in moves, disasters, changes in lifestyles are now not an issue as your journal is safe and secure in the cloud. You no longer have to worry about others reading your most sacred thoughts. If you change operating systems or just take a break from journaling, you can pick up right where you left off. Then when you’re ready to preserve it for your family you can print your entries for a Journal Binder.</p>

							<h1>Journals </h1>
							<p>Journals are a valuable resource for helping us organize our thoughts. Journals can help us structure our thoughts in a way that allows them to make sense. At times we come up with brilliant ideas that we cannot explore at the moment.  Journey with Journals allows us to add a tag so we can go back and expand on it later. Having your phone with you can allow you to record on the go, attach photos of your memories and then add to them later. If you forgot to record that important event when it happened, you can go back to that day on your calendar and add it in as if you never missed it.</p>
							<p>Journey with Journals will give you more flexibility now than ever. For those who journal now in a hard book, this will give you more ease of use. Imagine having a hard day, climbing in bed and turning off the lights. Then as you lay there you realize that you didn’t write in your journal. Now you can simply pick up your phone and dictate your experience with voice-to-text right into your journal. Attach a photo and then sleep tight as that worry is now off your mind.</p>
							<p>You can have the ability to add multiple journals a day. This could be very helpful on those busy days. Saturday morning comes and you start off at a pancake breakfast with friends. You simply record your thoughts and who was there. Then take a group photo and add it to the entry. Then just after lunch your son has a soccer game. You record the event and take a picture of him scoring his goal, and now you have a second journal entry for the day. Then evening comes around and you go to the in-laws for dinner. Who just happened to invite a couple of Aunts and Uncles to join. You discuss vacation plans and before you know it, you have a third entry with a family photo or two or three. The day comes to an end, and you are feeling really blessed by the lord that you have so many good people in your life. Now you have the need to record your grateful moments and maybe this one doesn’t need a photo. It’s your choice. Since you tagged each entry, you can go back and easily find the entry to relive those good times.</p>

							<h1>Routines </h1>
							<p>Routines are an important part of Journey with Journals. If you are not in the habit of writing in a journal each night, this is a simple way to message yourself with a reminder. Think of routines as a way to make a desire to become a habit. Routines can be shared with others. It is often easier to accomplish things when you have someone on your side or making the journey with you. You will find many categories to schedule your routines under such as: Fitness, Learning, Wellness, Wealth, Health, and Meditation.</p>
							<p>Simply pick a category, label the routine, set the recurrence, and give a description of what you want to accomplish. Then either keep it to yourself or share the routine with someone else. Once you no longer need to be reminded simply change it to a new routine. Your reminder will come as a notification to your phone. </p>
							<p><b>Ideas for Reminders:</b></p>
							<ul>
								<li>To write in my journal daily @ 9 pm</li>
								<li>To read my scriptures in the morning</li>
								<li>To do my sit-ups at night @ 8pm</li>
								<li>To add to my savings on payday</li>
								<li>To water my plants every Tuesday @ 5pm</li>
								<li>To take my vitamins on Monday, Wednesday, Friday @ 8am</li>

							<h1>Communities </h1>
							<p>Communities were built into the Journey with Journals app as a bonus. It is a fun way to stay interacted with the app. With the end goal of keeping recording in your journal fresh in your mind. The more you interact with the app, the more likely you are to record your memories as you journey through life. Which is the reason you are interested in keeping a journal. As mentioned before, years down the road when you can go back and see your struggles as well as your accomplishments, it is our hope that it will bring you joy to see just how far you have come.</p>
							<p>Depending on your Plan level you will have the opportunity to view, participate, or create in the Community Section of the App. Seeing what others who have the same interests as you do, can be enlightening. Share your thoughts, find solutions to your struggles with others who have been down the same road. You can share pictures and ideas that have brought you success in your hobbies, work accomplishments, or places you recommend to others.</p>
							<p>It is exciting to create a community that others find of interest. Having new people give you ideas and share experiences about what you hold special can be a growing experience. You can make community topics a local experience or a worldwide interest. We are sure you will find it exciting to explore all the new communities that are being added all of the time.</p>
							<p>We strive to keep our communities professional and respectful. Please make sure you read the Terms and Conditions for Communities before participating. We want everyone to feel comfortable with what they read and see in your posts. We always expect our patrons to report anything they feel is inappropriate.  Remember you only see Communities that you are following. You won’t see things you are not interested in.</p>
							<p>Ideas for Communities:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Hobbies</li>
								<li>Vacation spots</li>
								<li>Fans of the Dallas Cowboys (or your team)</li>
								<li>Crafts</li>
								<li>Things to see in Denver (or in your city)</li>
								<li>Kayaking in Missouri (or your area)</li>
								<li>Good cruises to take</li>
								<li>I’m learning Spanish (or any language)</li>
								<li>Favorite songs of the 80’s</li>
